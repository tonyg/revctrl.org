# Simple Weave Merge

This algorithm has sometimes been known as [PreciseCodevilleMerge](PreciseCodevilleMerge.md); however, as the [Codeville](Codeville.md) developers wish to reserve the pcdv name for whatever algorithm they eventually decide to implement, a new name was chosen.  It is the first complete algorithm to temporarily bear the name [PreciseCodevilleMerge](PreciseCodevilleMerge.md), and the eventual [PreciseCodevilleMerge](PreciseCodevilleMerge.md) will most likely be a variation on it, with the addition of such features as [Convergence](Convergence.md), [ImplicitUndo](ImplicitUndo.md), and fixes for certain CrissCrossMerge [ordering ambiguities](CrissCrossMerge.md#orderingambiguities).
