Convergent scalar merge is a scalar merge algorithm based on the property that if A and B are merged and A has an ancestor whose history is isomorphic to B's history, then A should win. It's similar to MarkMerge, and can be thought of as the scalar version of PreciseCodevilleMerge (in fact, they were developed in tandem).
