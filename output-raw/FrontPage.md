''It would be nice to have a summary of the top N distributed version control systems, with some tips to help a programmer choose the best one for her situation. ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revision_control_software#Software_using_a_distributed_approach|Wikipedia lists over a dozen distributed control systems]]). Perhaps use http://lwn.net/Articles/151624/ as a starting point for a quick paraphrase and summary, then fill in other systems and details as we think of them? What to call that summary -- PickingYourVersionControlSystem ?''

Is it possible to make a NeutralInterface ?
