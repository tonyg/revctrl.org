This algorithm has sometimes been known as PreciseCodevilleMerge; however, as the ["Codeville"] developers wish to reserve the pcdv name for whatever algorithm they eventually decide to implement, a new name was chosen.  It is the first complete algorithm to temporarily bear the name PreciseCodevilleMerge, and the eventual PreciseCodevilleMerge will most likely be a variation on it, with the addition of such features as ["Convergence"], ImplicitUndo, and fixes for certain [:CrissCrossMerge#orderingambiguities:ordering ambiguities].
