# A Partial Extract of revctrl.org

In recent years the `revctrl.org` wiki has fallen victim to spam,
making it hard to find the valuable content that still resides there.
This is an attempt at extracting what remains of value.

Produced partly by hand, partly using the `scrape/pull` script, then
removed obvious spam links from the files in `output-raw` and
converted to Markdown.

The page contents were downloaded on the 12th July 2012.

 - scraped, archived, and edited by Tony Garnock-Jones <tonyg@leastfixedpoint.com>
 - spam cleanup and improvements to formatting by Michael Haggerty <mhagger@alum.mit.edu>

## Authors

Unfortunately, all the edit history of the wiki was lost, and
individual pages do not have clear authorship. All we have is a record
of the wikipages named after some of the people who made contributions
to the site.

Here, then, is a partial list of (presumed) authors. If anyone has
more information about authorship of the content here, please [contact
me](mailto:tonyg@leastfixedpoint.com):
