# Uncategorised pages

The `revctrl.org` wiki followed the original C2 WikiWiki convention of
tagging pages with any number of `Category[Something]` links, relying
on backlinks and the search facility to produce useful indexes.
Unfortunately, because only a few of the wiki's pages were rescuable,
and not all were categorised, only a limited amount of index structure
is available to us. The following pages are those that fall outside of
the categories discernable from the rescued wiki markup.
