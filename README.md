# A Partial Extract of revctrl.org

In recent years the `revctrl.org` wiki has fallen victim to spam,
making it hard to find the valuable content that still resides there.
This is an attempt at extracting what remains of value.

Produced partly by hand, partly using the `pull` script in this
directory, then removed obvious spam links from the files in
`output-raw`.

The page contents were downloaded on the 12th July 2012.

Perhaps I'll make a PDF or a TiddlyWiki of the content or something.
