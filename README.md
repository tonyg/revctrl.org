# A Partial Extract of revctrl.org

In recent years the `revctrl.org` wiki has fallen victim to spam,
making it hard to find the valuable content that still resides there.
This is an attempt at extracting what remains of value.

Read the content here: **<https://tonyg.github.io/revctrl.org/>**

Produced partly by hand, partly using the `scrape/pull` script, then
removed obvious spam links from the files in `output-raw` and
converted to Markdown.

The page contents were downloaded on the 12th July 2012.
